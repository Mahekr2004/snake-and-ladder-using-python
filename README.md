# Snake and Ladder Game â€“ Python Project

This is a classic Snake and Ladder game built using Python.  
It's a simple, interactive, terminal-based game for two players.  
Roll the dice, climb ladders, avoid snakes, and race to the finish.

Pythin code for the game :

import turtle
import random
import cv2  # Import OpenCV for video playback

screen = turtle.Screen()

def movePlayer1(player, position):
    yPos = (position-1) // 10
    xPos = (position-1) % 10
    y = -170 + yPos * 37
    if yPos % 2 == 0:
        x = -170 + xPos * 38
    else:
        x = 170 - xPos * 38
    player.goto(x, y)

def movePlayer2(player, position):
    yPos = (position-1) // 10
    xPos = (position-1) % 10
    y = -170 + yPos * 37
    if yPos % 2 == 0:
        x = -165 + xPos * 38
    else:
        x = 165 - xPos * 38
    player.goto(x, y)

        if not ret:

        cv2.imshow('Snake Attack!', frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(30) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
